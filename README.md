# 🧠✨ Custom Chatbot with Real Tool Access using OpenAI

Welcome to your **AI sidekick**—a chatbot that doesn’t just talk, it **does things**.  
Think of it as a conversational Swiss Army knife: powered by **OpenAI** and supercharged with **real-world tool access**.

---

## ⚡ Features

This notebook-powered chatbot can (depending on the tools you’ve wired in):

- 🔢 **Do the math** – from simple arithmetic to serious number crunching.  
- 🌐 **Search the web** – pull in fresh knowledge when your brain needs backup.  
- ☀️ **Check the weather** – ask “Is it sunny in Delhi?” and find out.  
- 📰 **Fetch real-time info** – news, finance, maps, or APIs you connect.  
- 💬 **Hold conversations** – natural, context-aware dialogue thanks to OpenAI.  

*(Open the notebook and fill in any custom tools you’ve added—this is your bragging rights section!)*

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone this repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thedynasty23/Custom-Chatbot-with-Real-Tool-Access-using-Openai.git

   ```

2. **Install requirements** 📦

   ```

3. **Launch the notebook** 📓  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Custom_Chatbot_with_Real_Tool_Access\ \(4\).ipynb
   ```

4. **Chat away** 🎉  
   - Type in natural language queries.  
   - Watch as the bot decides when to talk and when to act.  
   - Example:  
     > **You**: "What’s 123 × 456?"  
     > **Bot**: *uses calculator tool* → `56088`

## 🛠️ How It Works

- 🧩 **Jupyter Notebook** → interactive playground for development and testing.  
- 🤖 **OpenAI Model** → powers natural language understanding.
